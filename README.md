## Core Features

![options](./config.png)

- **Anonymous Chat**: Users can chat anonymously with configurable send and receive permissions.
- **Spam Prevention**: Implement time delays between messages to prevent spam from the same IP/user.
- **Message Limit**: Set a maximum number of messages to be stored in the database.
- **Ban Management**: Maintain a list of banned users who are restricted from accessing the chat.
- **Character limit**: Limit the maximum allowed characters per message to ensure concise communication.

## Styling

The chat design inherits the style from the standard theme CSS, ensuring a consistent look and feel. All CSS classes are defined in the `style.css` file. If you want to customize the style, you can edit this file directly or create a new plugin to override the CSS rules of the chat plugin.

In addition to the `.msg` CSS class, every message has an additional class `.msg-anon` for guest's messages and `.msg-user` for logger users messages.
